[Solid](https://github.com/solid), an initiative led by Tim Berners-Lee, is a set of specifications, including examples of these specification, on how to achieve the goal of decentralising power on the web to ensure that the web is used for the global public interest. 

Web Civics has forked the repo due to disturbing policies managing various aspects relating to the growth of solid, that needed to be addressed in a timely manner.

This Web Civics version - of the community repository is designed to give an overview of how [Solid](https://github.com/solid) can be developed using a range of specific techniques and codified considerations relating to moral grammar, and describe how this may be used to leverage solid as to create new community works that are made possible using solid related technologies.
